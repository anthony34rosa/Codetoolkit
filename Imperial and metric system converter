 * Pseudocode or Algorithm for the program:
    (be sure to indent items with control structure)
    (need to match flow chart submitted in documentation)
  1.ask user to enter country
  2.display converter tool kit and ask what user would like to do
  3.ask user to select option
  4.if user selects option 1 ask for temp in celsius
  5.convert to fahrenheit and display result
  6.thank user and end program
  7.if user chooses 2 convert distance from kilometers to miles
  8.display result end program
  9.if user chose 3 convert weight from kilograms to pounds
 10.mention users country
 11.then display result and cout thank user and end program
 12.if the user chose 4 end programs display a thank you message.
